# Day 13 & 14 - Users and Groups

- you can use `grep GID /etc/login.defs` to see the ID values for normal groups and system groups
- System Groups will have a value between 100-999
- Normal Groups will have a value between 1000 - 60000
- You can use this to identify which group is which
- you can use `getent group {1000..60000}` to view the normal groups
- you can add groups using `sudo groupadd groupname`
- to modify group you can use `groupmod` 
- e.g. `sudo groupmod -n newname currentname` to change name
- to delete group use `groupdel`
- ^ All the above also applies to users
- `sudo adduser username` to add user
- this is better than using `useradd` because it gives you more permissions that you may need
- to change a users password use `sudo passwd < users name whos password you want to change >`
- to delete user `sudo userdel`
- Use `sudo su username` to switch users
- `exit` to exit user
- you should see in your home directory, every user gets its own folder
- `- rwx rwx rwx` the first 3 denote the permissions for the user, followed by group, and then others
- stand for read, write, execute permissions
- `umask -S` to check permissions, the -S is for symbolic notation
- using umask without the -S will show you the octal notation e.g. `0002`
- the first number is directory, the next 3 are for permissions like users, groups, others
- when switching to another user you created and trying to create files, you may get a warning saying user is not in sudoers file
- To access the file use `sudo visudo`
- In this file, you can enter a users name under root privileges to give them root permissions
